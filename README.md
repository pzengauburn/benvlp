# Bayesian Inference for Envelope Models 

This repository contains a collection of code and preprints for Bayesian inference for envelope models. 

- [rolem](rolem/): A Bayesian approach for robust longitudinal envelope models
- benvlp_0.1-0.tar.gz: Version 0.1 provides the following functions 
    * rolem(): robust longitudinal envelope models assuming t-distributed random errors
    * lem(): longitudinal envelope models assuming normally-distributed random errors
    * rlmm(): linear mixed-effect models assuming t-distributed random errors
    * summary(): compute BIC, WAIC, posterior means, HPD intervals, etc
